# BW Med Cabinet 3
## ‚òùÔ∏è Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?
- App for new cannabis consumers (especially those trying to get off of pharmaceuticals) who want to use cannabis as a means to battle medical conditions and ailments. Help patients find the right strains, dosing, intake method and intake schedule! 


### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- User is able to search for strains by recommendations and have the ability to save favorite strains and look for local dispensaries.


### What is the mission statement?
- We will create an app that efficiently assists the user in finding the best strain for them.


## üí° Features

### What features are required for your minimum viable product?
DS:
- Source and analyze data to better understand the reported effects of different cannabis strains/types
- Given this, create a model to predict which strains/types a user would enjoy based on their input (desired effects). Can use any techniques you wish. 
- Make the recommendations accessible to the rest of the team via a Flask API or equivalent. 


### Web:
- User creation and login
- Form to gather data from the user to submit to the DS API
- User can save response from the DS API to the Web backend in the user's profile
- User can view saved responses and filter them in a useful way
- User can edit/delete saved responses in the user's profile.


### What features may you wish to put in a future release?
DS:
- Improve model performance by sourcing additional data and/or tuning hyperparameters

Web:
- Link user to dispensary that has product that fulfills their needs
